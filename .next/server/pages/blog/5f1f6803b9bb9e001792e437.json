Conversely, server-side storage will store data on the server (i.e. an external database).","description":"You probably have heard of cookies. They are the most classic type of client-side storage and have been used by sites since the early days of the web.\nCookies are sent from the server to the client and then stored on the client. The stored cookie can then be retrieved and sent back to the server whenever the client makes a request to the server again. Typically, cookies are used to manage account sessions, store user information and track user data.\nHowever, because cookies are the oldest forms of client-side storage, they have a few security issues and storage limitations, which make them an unsuitable option to store client-side data.\nFor more information on the security issues of cookies, read here.\nCRUD Example\n//Create\ndocument.cookie = \"name=victoria\";\n\n//Read\nconsole.log( document.cookie );\n\n//Update\ndocument.cookie = \"name=victoria lo\";\n\n//Delete - Just set an expiry date that has passed\ndocument.cookie = \"name=victoria lo ; expires = Thu, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT\"\n2. Web Storage API\nThe Web Storage API is an API which stores key-value pairs of data in the client. This simple and intuitive syntax allows easy storage and retrieval of strings or stringified JSON data.\nThere are 2 types of web storage in this API: Local Storage and Session Storage.\nLocal Storage vs Session Storage\nSome distinct differences between the 2 types of web storage to note.","__v":0}},"__N_SSG":true}
