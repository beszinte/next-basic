The biggest advantage lies in cross-platform development. With React Native, you have a single codebase that can be built for both iOS and Android devices. For most companies, this saves a lot of time and money, as native mobile development requires two different codebases and two different teams — native iOS development being done in Swift and native Android development being done in Java/Kotlin. Especially if you’re a developer who knows JavaScript but not Swift, Java, or Kotlin, it makes sense to simply use React Native to develop a mobile app because of faster shipping time (i.e. the time saved from learning a new language and development environment).
Another emerging framework for cross-platform development is Flutter, an open-source UI toolkit created by Google. The only disadvantages that I know of are that it uses the Dart language (so you’ll need to spend time learning it) and it’s relatively new, so there may be not as much community support. However, I can see Flutter as the new mainstream way of cross-platform development in the future, so I think it’s definitely worth learning if you have the time. But for now, React Native is still the king of this cross-platform business.</p></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"pictures":["https://res.cloudinary.com/beloved/image/upload/v1595894282/Udemy/wzcux8epelmpxwjwj5nd.jpg"],"_id":"5f1f6a0bb9bb9e001792e43c","title":"From React to React Native","description":"Why React Native?\nThe biggest advantage lies in cross-platform development.
