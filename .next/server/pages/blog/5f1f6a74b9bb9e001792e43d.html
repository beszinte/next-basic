But it’s also true that it takes more than just technological expertise to rise through the ranks and win the opportunity to command teams, projects, and eventually businesses.
By developing and broadening your non-technical skills, you increase the chances of not just landing a “good job” but a great career in technology as well.
“The soft skills are the hard skills. People who master the critical leadership skills today are anything but touchy-feely — they’re direct, they’re clear, they’re compassionate, they’re no-nonsense. But they’re not soft.” — Amy Edmondson
Here is a list of non-technical skills that will ensure you a great career in tech.
1. Self-Discipline
It is easy for someone to get distracted in life. Self-discipline is what helps you focus on your goals. A disciplined developer is able to do things on time, take responsibility for what they do, and more. Being responsible for your actions is essential for you to succeed in your professional life.
“Taking responsibility when things go wrong is crucially important to building trust with others and learning from your mistakes.” — Ryan Ferguson
A self-disciplined developer not only keeps themselves on track but also helps lift up others as well.
Although you don’t necessarily need to have a strict code of conduct, you still need a moderate level of self-discipline that keeps you and your goals in sync.
2. People Skills
“You can have brilliant ideas, but if you can’t get them across, your ideas won’t get you anywhere.” — Lee Iacocca
People always prefer to work with someone who is able to connect with them on a humane level. So the more you show these abilities, the faster your career advances.
According to Science of People’s Vanessa Van Edwards, people skills are the tools you use to communicate and interact effectively with others. Therefore, it reduces the chance of miscommunication in the workplace, which is very important.
Your project team or workplace may contain a lot of diversity, and for you to fit right in, you need excellent people skills. This would result in your team completing projects exceptionally well — and you would stand out.
3. Intellectual Curiosity
To go up the ladder, developers should start asking questions and looking at problems from different angles to get better solutions. Going with the flow will not help you in this regard.
