Client-side Routing
Before we begin implementing react-router, let’s discuss the difference between server and client side routing. Server-side is the more traditional approach where we define the routes on the server. Client-side is the more modern approach where we use client-side Javascript to dynamically change what gets shown to the screen. With client-side routing, we handle the rendering of our application.
The process on the server-side would be a client making a request to the server and the server responding with what HTML to render. The process on the client-side would involve watching for URL changes and based on those changes, render a specific component for the path.
With client-side, when a user clicks for a different page or gets redirected based on some action, that’s going to be handled with client-side Javascript meaning we do not need to make the roundtrip on the server to re-enter the page. Instead, we use the HTML history API available by browsers that allows us to watch for URL changes and run some Javascript code when it does change.
With react-router, we’re able to render an application on the fly with client-side Javascript that’s going to allow us to create a Single Page Application where we switch components emulating the “page change.”
Getting Started
To get started with implementing react-router, you’ll need to have a React application. If you need to create one, you can use the following command to generate one and change into the directory generated:
npx create-react-app &lt;app_name&gt;
cd &lt;app_name&gt;
React-router has three packages: react-router, react-router-dom, react-router-native. React-router almost never has to be installed whereas react-router-dom is specific to the browser and react-router-native is specific to React Native. We will be focusing on the website and thus will need to install react-router-dom using:</p></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"pictures":["https://res.cloudinary.com/beloved/image/upload/v1595894167/Udemy/rb3kxw0lxxgshc8bomwx.png"],"_id":"5f1f6997b9bb9e001792e43b","title":"How to add React Router to your React App","body":"React-router is a tool that can be implemented on top of a React application. React, by itself, does not dictate anything about routing. Routing can sync the application with the URL along with the navigation features offered by the browser such as the address bar and navigation buttons enhancing the capabilities of your React application.
