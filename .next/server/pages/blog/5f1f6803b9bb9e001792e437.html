They are the most classic type of client-side storage and have been used by sites since the early days of the web.
Cookies are sent from the server to the client and then stored on the client. The stored cookie can then be retrieved and sent back to the server whenever the client makes a request to the server again. Typically, cookies are used to manage account sessions, store user information and track user data.
However, because cookies are the oldest forms of client-side storage, they have a few security issues and storage limitations, which make them an unsuitable option to store client-side data.
For more information on the security issues of cookies, read here.
CRUD Example
//Create
document.cookie = &quot;name=victoria&quot;;

//Read
console.log( document.cookie );

//Update
document.cookie = &quot;name=victoria lo&quot;;

//Delete - Just set an expiry date that has passed
document.cookie = &quot;name=victoria lo ; expires = Thu, 01 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT&quot;
2. Web Storage API
The Web Storage API is an API which stores key-value pairs of data in the client. This simple and intuitive syntax allows easy storage and retrieval of strings or stringified JSON data.
There are 2 types of web storage in this API: Local Storage and Session Storage.
Local Storage vs Session Storage
Some distinct differences between the 2 types of web storage to note.</p></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"data":{"pictures":["https://res.cloudinary.com/beloved/image/upload/v1595893763/Udemy/le9kh0jkuu26l2wa18ll.png"],"_id":"5f1f6803b9bb9e001792e437","title":"Client-Side Storage in JavaScript","body":"As the name suggests, client-side storage allows the user to store data on the client (i.e. user’s browser).
